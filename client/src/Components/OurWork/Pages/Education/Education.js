The residents of these households include migrants, half of them being among the poorest of the poor. More than eight million children under 6 years live in approximately 49,000 slums. There are 22.72 million children (age group 5-18) living in urban slums who are out of school.* 
            The migrant population in India is mostly illiterate and constantly on the move, in search of new livelihood opportunities.  Migrant children move with their parents and often lose out on age-appropriate educational opportunities. Often they engage in labor to escape poverty and support their parents.

               Access to early childhood care, balanced nutrition, education, health, and recreational facilities are keys to the positive development of children.  However, in places where clean drinking water and two square meals are a struggle, slum children’s education, health and other contributing factors for development will always take a backseat.

               <h5>EASSAY COMPETITION</h5>
               <p>
               Competition inspires kids to do their best – not just good enough. When students compete, they learn more and more from each other, whether it is their failure or win. They will try to do more than is required every time they face someone. These abilities prepare children for future situations of all kinds. The ability to be competitive will give them an important edge. More importantly our goal is to motivate students so that they can find different ways to boost up their skills and be more creative along with this they also learn about their limitations and how to surpass them in mere amount of time. Writing encourages writers to widen their thoughts and emotions both internally and relationally. Not only do children have a chance to think about their own thoughts and feelings about a topic they may not have considered before, but to consider the larger world in a way they might not have before. In turn, essay contests can build self-esteem, since it gives you and others a chance give the child recognition and encouragement for a job well done! Plus, it provides a satisfying feeling of accomplishment to them.

               <h5>ART COMPETITION</h5>
               <p>
               Art has a language of its own. From moulding a child’s personality to giving women a chance to stand out to creating colourful spaces to live in, the initiative taken by “God’s Creation” have proved how colours can make a difference and provide a better life for people in our society. Art helped children to express things what they can’t explain it to someone. Art is a process of learning to create ourselves and experience the world in new ways. It supports the bigger view of life: beauty, symbols, spirituality, storytelling, and allows us to be present in the moment. Art keeps the magic alive. Creating art can take your mind off life’s many stresses, at least momentarily. It clears some head space and allows one to focus on the good in life. Simple things like holding a paintbrush and scribbling with a crayon are an important element to developing a child’s fine motor skills. Art education teaches students how to interpret, criticize, and use visual information, and how to make choices based on it.
